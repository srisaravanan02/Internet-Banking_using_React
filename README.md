The aim of this project is to develop a modern internet banking website using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website will provide a secure and convenient platform for customers to perform various banking activities such as checking account balances, transferring funds, paying bills, and managing their account information.

The website will consist of several main pages such as the login page, dashboard, account details page, transaction history page, and payment page. The login page will be the first page customers see upon accessing the website, and it will require customers to enter their credentials to authenticate and gain access to their account.

Once customers have successfully logged in, they will be taken to the dashboard page, which will provide a quick overview of their account balances and recent transactions. The account details page will allow customers to view and manage their personal information, such as their name, address, and contact details.

The transaction history page will display all the recent transactions made by the customer, including details such as the date, time, amount, and description. Customers will also be able to filter and search for specific transactions using various criteria.

The payment page will enable customers to make payments to other accounts or pay bills directly from their account. Customers will be able to enter the recipient's account details and the amount to be transferred, and they can also set up recurring payments for regular bills.

The website will use modern design techniques and be responsive to various devices and screen sizes, ensuring that customers can access their account from any device. The website will also be secure, using industry-standard encryption protocols to protect customer information and prevent unauthorized access.

Overall, the Internet Banking Website Using React project aims to provide a user-friendly and secure platform for customers to manage their finances conveniently and efficiently.
